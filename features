add this to calendar
mount uploader to photos 

distinguish between types of workouts and find photos to match them 
	i.e. cardio would be a person on a treadmill, lifting would be man at the gym 

think social networks -- integrate the app with instagram so you can share gym buddy photos  and tag them 

how is the notion of a "profile page" accomplished?


Finding the gym buddy -
	show all users except current user
	exclude users who the current user has already disliked (at least for some time)

Add all the gyms in NYC (or at least a smaller sample for now)
